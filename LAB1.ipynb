        "After completing my line graph over the course of the first two weeks in January the results were quit suprising. There were only two points during the first two weeks where there was snowfall. January 6th had 0.3 inches and January 11th had 1.1 inches. Using this form of visualization we were able to better analyze the snowfall for the first two weeks in January. The graph allows viewers to understand and follow the content easily while also being able to understand what the author is trying to illustrate. "
